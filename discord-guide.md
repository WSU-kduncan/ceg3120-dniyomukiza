### BOT DOCUMENTATTION
#### I. Set up
* Set up a Discord account
* Create an application that will interact with Discord API
* you also need to create a bot and add it to your application
    *  What you need to install:
           1. pip install -U discord.py(some environment will require ou to get pip3 to install packages)
           2. You nee a .env file to keep your token in(you do not need to name this file,just .env extension is enough)
           3. To work with environment files, you need to run pip install -U python-dotenv(if you want to use Discord API V9, you may need to install discord.py package version 1.7.3, but if you have API V10 that uses intents, you need discord package of 2.0.1 version)
           4. last but no least, you need to install python3 if you choose pyhton as your language

#### II. Usage
1. You need to type capital 'H' followed by lowercase 'i'with an exclamation mark. This is what you should exactly type to initiate your conversation: **Hi!**
2. This one of the questions you may ask discord bot
     * Do you worry your technology provider is doing everything in their control to provide digital security?
     * Tell me your favorite technology tool and why you use it
     * how old are you
     
            **NOTE:** You must type those questions as they appear. The bot is case sensitive. Copying a question and paste it is highly encouraged to avoid typos
3. After asking one of the above questions you can react to the bot reply by typing one of these two words:
      * funny
      * sad
4. End conversation by saying goobye. type **goobye!**

#### III. Challenge
As you work on this project you may be surprised to see that when you close terminal, your bot will go offline. There is not only one way to go around this, but websites linke discloudbot.com can help you host your discord project and keep your bot running 24/7. If your are interested in finding how, this is a youtube video that I found useful ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxlYQiaD1I])
